              as a Systems Engineer. I love writing code to build solutions to
              real world problems. Over the last 4 years, I have worked in 4
              companies (one of them being my own &#128521;), participated in 3
              hackathons (and won one of them &#128522;) and built numerous side
              projects!
            </p>

            <p>
              Primarily a full stack Javascript developer, I am skilled in the
              MERN stack. I have experience in building web/mobile apps using
              Node.js, Express, MongoDB/MySQL, React & React Native. Besides
              that, I am a skilled Cloud and DevOps engineer. I have worked with
              cloud technologies like Amazon Web Services, Digital Ocean and
              Firebase to build and deploy applications securely in a scalable
              manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also have some experience in Java and Python. I have worked on
              native android apps using Java and Android Studio and written
              automation/scraping scripts using Python.
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, I am a jack of all trades (and master of a few!ðŸ˜‰) .
